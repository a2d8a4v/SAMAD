## What is SAMAD?
SAMAD is a speech assessment model which consists of three important ingredients: **prompt-relevance, delivery, and language use.** Each module is designed to specific criteria essential for the evaluation of spontaneous spoken responses.

## Features
* **Optimized with soft labels to emphasize the ordinal properties of automatic speech assessment tasks.**
* **Combines self-supervised pre-trained (SSL) models with handcrafted indicator features to enrich the representation of spoken responses.**
* **Specifically designed to target criteria essential for the evaluation of spontaneous spoken responses.**

## How to get the dataset?
* To obtain the dataset, please reach out to the Language Training & Testing Center (LTTC).
